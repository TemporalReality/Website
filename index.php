										<h3>Why Temporal Reality?</h3>
										<!--<p>The Temporal Reality core team members all came from different modded Minecraft communies. After we saw the direction they were taking, and the decisions they were making, we all agreed the changes they were making could harm the community. So we made our own.</p>--><p>Temporal Reality offer a modded Minecraft launcher which aims to make sure that your modpack, no matter how popular you are, or the next guy is, will get treated equally. We also want to strive to be one of the most welcoming communities out there, by allowing similar equal treatment to every member of our community, whether you're a modpack developer, server host, or an avid player of modded Minecraft.</p>

							<h4>Why are we different?</h4>
Temporal Reality aims to try and please every group of the modded minecraft community:<br>
<li>Mod developers - We aim to please mod developers by making sure that whenever a mod is launched through our launcher, they get another download from their mod. This is done so mods hosted on CurseForge will get a download each time it is downloaded as part of a modpack; giving the mod dev more Curse points, while also respecting the permissions put in place by the mod dev.</li>
<li>Pack developers - We want to offer pack developers an equal oppurtunity to get their packs noticed. So we won't highlight just the best packs. At the minute the most we will do is offer pack devs a custom user title on the forums, and a way for other members to identify them. </li>

					<div class="content">
						<header>
<li>Server Hosts - This applies to both server owners and server hosting companies. We would like to encourage both parties to advertise their services to the community. This is because we know that whenever there is a popular modpack, people want to play it on a server. However, we also understand that server hosts don't have endless amounts of money, so they will look for the best server providers.</li>
  <li>Players - If you play modded Minecraft, you probably already know a good community is essential. Whether it be somewhere to post bug reports, somewhere you can ask for help, or just somewhere to get involved with other people; making friends, finding servers, or just general chit-chat.</li>
